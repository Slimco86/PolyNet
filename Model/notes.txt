Some background knowledge on uncertainty in deep learning: there are two types of uncertainties, epistemic uncertainty, and aleatoric uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty is the model uncertainty that can be explained away with more data. Aleatoric uncertainty is the data uncertainty that cannot be explained away by more data. Aleatoric uncertainty can be further classified into two types, data-dependent heteroscedastic uncertainty and task-dependent homoscedastic uncertainty. Specifically, the authors propose to use homoscedastic uncertainty to weigh different tasks.
